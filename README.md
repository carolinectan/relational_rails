## Description:
* Created webpages that allow users to CRUD (create, read, update, and destroy) resources
* Used a schema designer to design database tables with one to many relationships (i.e. A Farm has many Farmers; a Farmer belongs to a Farm. A Garden has many Plants; a Plant belongs to a Farmer.)
* Wrote migrations to create tables with columns of varying data types and foreign keys
* Created instance and class methods on a Rails model that use ActiveRecord methods and helpers
* Write model and feature tests that fully cover data logic and user behavior

## Technologies:
* Rails 5.2.6
* Ruby 2.7.2
* Active Record
* PostgreSQL
* Postico
* HTML/CSS
